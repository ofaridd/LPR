# License Plate Recognition (LPR)
This Project was aimed to Automatically recognize license plates using Neural Networks which is utilized using YOLOV8. Illustrated below is some images
prediction using YOLOV8 machine learning. For future implementations we will need to have a larger dataset, and increase iterations ‘epochs’ enhancing accuracy, and precision.
